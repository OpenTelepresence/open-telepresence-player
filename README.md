# Open Telepresence Player

Open Telepersence is a project that aims to create an open source multiplatform framework for an immersive telepresence experience based on 360 video. The core elements needed to provide such experience are:

* 360 camera live capture system with low-latency capacity (E2E latency must be less than 1 second)
* Multipltaform player to join the immersive experience
* Video backend to process/route video and metadata between the different clients participating in the immersive experience

For better integration and interoperability seek, all the communication protocols, video coding formats and hardware used to create such an experience should be as open as possible. Using low-cost setup (the needed hardware) is preferable whenever possible so more audience can make use of the technology.


Requirements: Unity 2021.3.2f1
