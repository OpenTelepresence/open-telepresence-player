# Open Telepresence Player

Open Teleprsence is a project that aims to create an open source multiplatform framework for immersive telepresence experience based on 360 video. The core elements to provide such experience are:

* 360 camera live capture system with low-latency capacity (E2E latency must be less than 1 second)
* Multipltaform player to join thte immersive experience
* Video backend to process/route video and metadata betweent the different clients participating in the immersive experience

For better integration and interoperability seek all the communication protocols, video coding formats and hardware used to create such experience should be as open as possible. Using low-cost setup (the needed hardware) is preferible whenever possible so more audience can make use of the technology.


Requirements: Unity 2021.3.2f1
